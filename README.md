# JAVA-Server-Client_controlPanel
A simple Server/Client control panel that can switch on and off three LEDs.
Initial it only works between two PCs as server/client. In the end the software is supposed to work with one PC using a GUI control panel (client) and a Raspberry Pi (server) to switch on/off LEDs.
